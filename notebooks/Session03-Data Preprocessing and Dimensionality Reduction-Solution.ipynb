    "\n",
    "Accordingly, this dataset contains information about 891 people who were on board the ship when departed on April 15th, 1912. As noted in the description on Kaggle's website, some people aboard the ship were more likely to survive the wreck than others. There were not enough lifeboats for everybody so women, children, and the upper-class were prioritized. Using the information about these 891 passengers, the challenge is to build a model to predict which people would survive based on the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Name** (str) - Name of the passenger\n",
    "- **Pclass** (int) - Ticket class\n",

    "- **Ticket** (str) - Ticket number\n",

    "## 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "**Data Preprocessing** is one of the most important (sometimes difficult) steps in machine-learning-based engineering. It not only significantly affects the final performance of a given model, but also, to some extent, determines which kind of model better fits the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, dity aquired data is very common, which means there are always missing values, outliers, badly-behaved distributions, etc. It is **essential** to clean these dity data to train a better-performed model. Additionally, most of machine learning models cannot be fed with some types of data, e.g. non-numerical data, while some of them perfer a certain type of data rather than others, e.g. random forest can be trained faster with histogramized data. Therefore, for the sake of not only adapting model input but also obtaining better performance, we have to preprocess data before we proceed to a further step.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sklearn` provides many tools which can help us implement data preprocessing easily. In this notebook, we will mainly focus on using this module to implement **missing value imputation**, basic **data transformation**, **standardization** and **normalization**. Techniques used to detect outliers and fix badly-behaved distributions can vary from data to data, so it might not be further discussed this time."

    "Standardization is used to adjust a feature from non-zero mean and non-norm variance normal distribution to standard normal distribution. Although sometimes we cannot ensure the feature satisfies a normal distribution, standardization is still very important to avoid a feature with big variance significantly leading the model training. In fact, a feature with big variance is likely to prevent the model learns from other features.\n",

    "In some scenarios, the data dimension (number of features) can be very large (sometimes tens kilo or larger), which leads to a very complex model that tends to overfit. Meanwhile, the data in high dimension always has certain redundancy. So, we might intend to reduce the dimensionality of the features to solve this problem.\n",

    "**PCA** aims to reduce the data dimension (n) by finding a new set of basis which can represent the data on k(k<n) dimensional space with maximum variance. The figure below demonstrates an example of PCA, which reduce the 3-D data to 2-D. Under the assumption that the bigger data variance indicates more abundant information, PCA is effective and widly applied.\n",
